- **Candy Matching**: Swap candies to match 3 or more candies in a row or column.

## 📜 Project Overview

This game is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

- **HTML** provides the structure of the game, including the grid where candies are placed, buttons to select the game mode, and the scoreboard.
- **CSS** is used to style the game elements, giving it a colorful and fun appearance, with hover effects for better interactivity.
- **JavaScript** handles the game logic, including creating the game board, checking for matches, updating the score, and managing the timer.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Choose a Mode**: Select your preferred game mode:
   - **Endless Mode**: No time limit—keep playing as long as you want!
   - **Timed Mode**: Try to score as high as you can in 2 minutes.
   
2. **Match Candies**: Swap adjacent candies to form a row or column of 3 or more matching candies. These candies will disappear, and new candies will fill the grid.

3. **Score Points**: Each match earns points, and your score will be displayed on the scoreboard. Keep matching candies to increase your score!

4. **Game Over**: In **Timed Mode**, the game ends when the timer runs out. In **Endless Mode**, the game continues until you decide to stop!
